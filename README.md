# fakebook

A fake social network, just like the real one.

## Dev Dependencies

- NPM (v2.14.x)
- Nodejs (v4.1.x)
- Compass (Ruby gem for processing SASS files)

## Build & development

- Clone the repo, run `npm install`.
- Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.

## P.S.

When testing, keep in mind that the APIs being used here are 100% public and therefore offer low bandwidth. 
If things just stop showing up on the page you've probably exceeded these limits.
